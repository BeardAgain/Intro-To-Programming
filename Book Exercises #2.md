# Project #

## Complete TWO of the following exercises: ##

1. Write a program to calculate the volume and surface area of a sphere from
its radius, given as input. Here are some formulas that might be useful:
V = 4/37rr3
A= 47rr2
2. Write a program that calculates the cost per square inch of a circular pizza,
given its diameter and price. The formula for area is A = Ï€r2
3. Write a program that computes the molecular weight of a carbohydrate (in
grams per mole) based on the number of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen
atoms in the molecule. The program should prompt the user to enter the
number of hydrogen atoms, the number of carbon atoms, and the number
of oxygen atoms. The program then prints the total combined molecular
weight of all the atoms based on these individual atom weights:
Atom Weight
(grams I mole)
H 1.00794
c 12.0107
0 15.9994
For example, the molecular weight of water (H20) is: 2(1.00794) +
15.9994 = 18.01528.
4. Write a program that determines the distance to a lightning strike based on
the time elapsed between the flash and the sound of thunder. The speed
of sound is approximately 1100 ft/ sec and 1 mile is 5280 ft.
5. The Konditorei coffee shop sells coffee at $10.50 a pound plus the cost
of shipping. Each order ships for $0.86 per pound + $1.50 fixed cost for
overhead. Write a program that calculates the cost of an order.
6. Two points in a plane are specified using the coordinates (x1,y1) and
(x2,y2). Write a program that calculates the slope of a line through two
(non-vertical) points entered by the user.
slope= y2 - y1 x2 - x1
7. Write a program that accepts two points (see previous problem) and determines
the distance between them.
distance= .j(x2- x1)2 + (y2- y1)2

## Complete ONE of the following exercises: ##

11. Write a program to find the sum of the first n natural numbers, where the
value of n is provided by the user.
12. Write a program to find the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers
where the value of n is provided by the user.
13. Write a program to sum a series of numbers entered by the user. The
program should first prompt the user for how many numbers are to be
summed. The program should then prompt the user for each of the numbers
in turn and print out a total sum after all the numbers have been
entered. Hint: Use an input statement in the body of the loop.
14. Write a program that finds the average of a series of numbers entered by
the user. As in the previous problem, the program will first ask the user
how many numbers there are. Note: The average should always be a float,
even if the user inputs are all ints.
15. Write a program that approximates the value of pi by summing the terms
of this series: 4/1- 4/3 + 4/5- 4/7 + 4/9- 4/11 + . . . The program should
prompt the user for n, the number of terms to sum, and then output the
sum of the first n terms of this series. Have your program subtract the
approximation from the value of math. pi to see how accurate it is.

## Complete TWO of the following exercises: ##

9. Write a program that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
10. Write a program that converts distances measured in kilometers to miles.
One kilometer is approximately 0.62 miles.
11. Write a program to perform a unit conversion of your own choosing. Make
sure that the program prints an introduction that explains what it does.
12. Write an interactive Python calculator program. The program should allow
the user to type a mathematical expression, and then print the value of the
expression. Include a loop so that the user can perform many calculations
(say, up to 100). Note: To quit early, the user can make the program
crash by typing a bad expression or simply closing the window that the
calculator program is running in. You'll learn better ways of terminating
interactive programs in later chapters.
