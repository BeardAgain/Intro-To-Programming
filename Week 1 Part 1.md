# Lesson Number 1

Your first day of Python! Have an open mind and let's get started.

# Lesson Outline #

Python Programming an Introduction to Computer Science by John Zelle. Third Edition

Chapter 2.1-2.5 Pages 27-41

## Intro ##

Welcome to Intro To Programming! We are going to jump right in to writing some code on the first day. Prepare yourself to learn quickly and be excited about the small things that you are able to accomplish. As we go through the lessons make sure to take your time and understand what is going on. There are additional resources in each lesson including this one. If you don't understand something, please do your best to give it more time. Nailing these concepts will aide you in completing the first project.

## Learning Outcomes ##

## Software Development Process ##

Before you write our first lines of code let's understand the process that should happen before you sit down to start working on a project. Open up the book flip to page 27 and read section 2.1. 

Let's recap the six steps that the book has in the development process.
1. Analyze the Problem
2. Determine Specifications
3. Create a Design
4. Implement the Design
5. Test / Debug the Program
6. Maintain the Program

We are going to work through a project idea together. Start to think about a project that you will want to do, because at the end of this lesson you will be asked to think through the Software Development Process on your own for your own project.

Our project is a Pizza Delivery Service for the MTech culinary program. Keep in mind this project is hypothetical, but try to think of it as a real life project.

1. Analyse the Problem

The Culinary Department makes great pizza but has no way for companies or people to order the pizza without coming into the cafeteria in person. They have the students willing to make the pizza and deliver it. 

2. Determine Specifications

To solve the problem we will create a mobile app that companies or people can order pizza, as well as have an interface for Mtech to be able to respond to orders. We will have to be able to login as a customer or as MTech. As a customer we need to be able to create an order, pay for the order, see where the delivery man is with up to date progress on the pizza, and give a review! As Mtech we need to be able to recieve orders, recieve payment, respond to reviews, give updates on the progress of the pizza, and manage their menu. Phew good thing we are not actually going to build this app it sounds like it will be a lot of work!

3. Create a Design

Time to start thinking about what this app is going to look like! How will they login, will they use Facebook, Google, Apple, etc... In this step we would draw out each screen and determine how a user would navigate throught the application. What algorithms or services may we need to make each aspect of the application doable. Since we are just getting started I want you to think about how the application will look. Don't worry right now about what algorithms you will use to accomplish the task. 

4. Implement the Design

This step is where you start to write the code. This is the longest step in the process. Every little aspect of the application needs code behind it. As programmers we don't touch step three very often, in most cirumstances there will be a designer who will think through that step for you. Our job is to create the application as close to the design as possible. Let's just think about a login page as an example. What colors will be used? How will the user enter their information? How will we manage the keyboard? If we are using a third party service, how do we interact with Facebook, Google, or Apple? If the user name is already taken, how will we know? How will we notify the user that their username is taken? There is a lot that goes into every aspect of a program it's your job to think through all of it. Programmers always say that they last 10% of the project takes just as long as the first 90%

5. Test / Debug the Program

Okay so we have written our code and our program is perfect and ready to go right? No, we aren't perfect there will always be errors. Never in your life will you write a perfect codebase and that's okay, it's expected! It is critical to test our program. Can you break it? What if I order 1,000 pizzas how will the system manage that? Should I be allowed to do that? 

6. Maintain the Program

New technologies are always coming out, there is always something new that you can add to the program. MTech may decide that their pizza delivery service is booming and wants to expand it to their Turkey Bacon Avocados sandwhiches (Mmm delicious 10/10 would recommend). Perhaps Facebook, Google, or Apple changed the way their login works and we need to update our code to match the new way to do. While a codebase may be great to start overtime there will be things that need to change. Updates are crucial to the success of a program. No program is done when it orignially hits production, there are always changes that have to happenf for the success of the program.

That's a quick look at what the Development Process may look like to build a Pizza Delivery App for MTech Culinary department. This whole process may takes years to follow through and do effectively. A reminder to start thinking of what kind of project you want to think through after this lesson in the assignment.

## Recap ##

Congratulations you finished your first lesson in coding! You've learned a little bit about the software development process. You should be able to think about each step and what needs to be done on each step. You wrote your first lines of code! You should be able to create a simple variable. As well you should be able to recieve input from the keyboard and give output as well! Well done!
