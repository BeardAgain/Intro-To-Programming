This project is going to built off of the project in unit 2. Your project is to build a graph to represent the data that you gatherered about a students progress in the second unit. 

An example would be a bar graph for each week that a student is in the class. Show how many assignments the student is able to accomplish in a week. 
Another example would be a coordinate system that shows the progress of the student. Starting at 0 with a line to their current progress and progress along the way at week increments.
You are free to think of your own example if you'd like.
