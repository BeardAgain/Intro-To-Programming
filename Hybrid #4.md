For your assignment we would like you to do some research into different programming options that are available to you. After this class you aren't qualified to go find a full time job yet. That doesn't mean that you can't start preparing now. There are lots of jobs out there and you need to find the career path for you. Look for other links and other helpful resources that can aide you in finding the right career path.

In order to complete this assignment you need to:
- List 3 other helpful links that taught you about other programming professions. 
- List out all of the programming options that you can find
- Choose the three that are most interesting to you
- List what you need to do next to start getting the education you need to get there
- Find 3 jobs for each of the programming options that most interest you
- Write a one page description on your plan to become a programmer, or why programming isn't for you.

Here at MTECH we offer Web Development and Mobile Development. If you want to learn more about those programs talk to a counselor or your teacher.
