Python Programming an Introduction to Computer Science by John Zelle. Third Edition

Chapter 4.1-4.4

## Intro ##

Today we will jump into something new and different. An important part of writing code is to not repeat yourself constantly. We are going to learn about classes and ways we can optimize our code to do more in less time.

## Learning Outcomes ##

- Be able to import third party code
- Be able to open up the graphs window
- Be able to draw simple shapes and figures
- Be able to color the shapes and outlines

## Vocabulary ##

- Class
- Graphs
- graphics.py
- Coordinate system
- Object

## Additional Resources ##

Links to videos and examples that they can go to in order to learn more

It is imperative that in this lesson you follow closely along with the book and code along in section 4.3 and on. The lesson portion in canvas will be limited in this lesson. We will go over a few things to get you ready for the assignment at the end. You can find the graphics.py file here in Canvas.

*Classes* In the future we will write our own classes together, but right now we will use a variety of classes in the graphs project. Think of a class as a blueprint. You can use the blueprint multiple times but it may vary slightly based on what materials you are using. Let's take a house as an example. We can create a class (blueprint) for the house. If we create 2 houses using the blueprint they would have the same shape and size. One house we use carpet while in the other we put hardwood in, maybe one is colored blue and the other white. Using the base blueprint we've created two houses, but they are slightly different. By using the blueprint we didn't have to go through and recreate every aspect of the house. 

Let's take a look at the example in the book. There is the Circle class. We can give it varying attributes like the fill color, outline color, and size. By using the class we don't have to draw every single dot in order to create the circle that work is done for us. In the assignment for this lesson you will be required to create some of your own drawings.


# Assignment #

Please turn in the code that you wrote with chapter thus far up until page 96.

For the second part of your assignment create a landscape of your choosing using the graphics file that has been provided for you. For example you could create a sun in the sky, a large rectangle of grass, an expanse of sea, or try your hand at creating a person using all the shapes available to you.
