# Project #

This is the last project you will be required to do in Python for this course. This is a really awesome project that you get to code along with. There will be things that you aren't familiar with, do not stresss about understanding every aspect of code. Do your best to do it on your own first, then watch the video to make sure that you did it correctly. If you are struggling with it feel free to watch the videos from the start. It is important that you complete the whole project. This will likely be the hardest thing you do in the class. Good luck, let the teacher know if you need help.
