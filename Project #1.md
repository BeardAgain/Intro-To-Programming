Your end of the unit project is an interactive course provided by Pluralsight. There may be things included that you have not quite learned yet. The course will walk you through every step that you need to take. If there is something that you haven't learned yet, just keep going through. We want you to get familiar with what code looks like and how it functions. This interactive course will aide you in some basic python that you have learned this unit.
