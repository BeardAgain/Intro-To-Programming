# Lesson Number 3.2 Graphs

# Lesson Outline #

Python Programming an Introduction to Computer Science by John Zelle. Third Edition

Chapter 4.5-4.8

## Intro ##

In the last lesson we learned about windows and how to draw objects. Today we will cover more complex drawings. You'll get the chance to draw your own bar graph, create your own polygons, and do some arthmatic based off of user input! 

## Learning Outcomes ##

- Be able to draw simple graphs and coordinates 
- Be able to get a mouse click and perform
- Be able to display a text box and gain user input

## Vocabulary ##

- Mouse Clicks
- Textual Input
- Bar Graph
- User Input

Like the last lesson please follow along with the book and build out the graph for future investment. You will be asked to turn it in for the assignment.

In the lesson section for today we aren't going to cover anything new. I want to emphasize the importance of the lesson in the book today. You just learned how to get user input and work with it in your programming. This is the basis of nearly all programming you will ever do. Think about every website you go to, every app you use, every program that is used on your computer. Each one of these programs take in user input and display information. Take for example a wikipedia.com. An informative website that has a lot of data to display to whoever navigates to their website. However they still take in a lot of user input. Users will click on different links to learn further about certain key words. As well there is a way to enter text. 

Now is a great time to reflect on what we have learned so far in the class. I hope that things are starting to come together for you. Right now you are capable of making simple applications that do math and or manipulate strings. Later on in this unit you'll get a chance to build something on your own. With the information you have right now you could build the basis of any kind of app that you would want to do. As well you are well on your way to having the programming basics down. 

# Assignment #

Please turn in on Canvas the three projects you did with the book. This includes the colored bar graph, three clicks triangle, and converting Celsius to Fahrenheit.
